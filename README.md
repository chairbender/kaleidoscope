# Kaleidoscope LLVM Tutorial
This is just my attempt at going through the LLVM Kaleidoscope tutorial in preparation for writing my
own compiler: https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/index.html

However, on top of this tutorial, I'm trying to practice using the most up-to-date modern C++26 standards and best practices (at least those supported
by Clang 20) and best practices, whereas the Kaleidoscope tutorial is rather old (but still super helpful for me!).
